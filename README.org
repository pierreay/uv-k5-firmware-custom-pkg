Helper and custom configuration of the Nunu UV-K5 firmware.

** About

Its a custom firmware for the [[http://en.qsfj.com/products/3002][Quansheng UV-K5]] walkie-talkie. My firmware of
choice is the Kamil (/a.k.a./ Nunu) firmware, optimized for fast scan, containing
the AM demodulation fix, and new spectrum analyzer features. It is a fork of
the Egzumer firmware.

*History*

The [[https://github.com/ludwich66/Quansheng_UV-K5_Wiki][Ludwich66]] repository contains a list of all the people participating to
reverse engineering the K5 (hardware, firmware encryption, flashing, custom
firmware). The [[https://github.com/amnemonic/Quansheng_UV-K5_Firmware][Amnemonic]] repository contains reverse-engineering effort
progress.

Alternative firmware are:

  (OSFW)]] (shipped with the radio) firmware, both based on a re-implementation
  of the original firmware by [[https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware][DualTachyon]]. First very popular firmware.

** Installation

*Using the ArchLinux PKGBUILD helper*

Clone this repository and enable or disable patches directly inside the
=PKGBUILD=:

#+begin_src tmux :eval never
git clone https://github.com/pierreay/uv-k5-firmware-custom-pkg.git
cd uv-k5-firmware-custom-pkg
# You may wnt to edit the PKGBUILD
#+end_src

Then, compile:

#+begin_src bash :eval never
makepkg
#+end_src

Finally, follow flashing instructions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Using original releases*

A firmware release can be directly flashed through the web interface, by
clicking on a parameterized HTTP links from the GitHub release page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Using original source code*

The other option is to locally clone the source code, configure the firmware
and use the web-interface uploading our local binary. I tried =k5prog= as in the
repository =Makefile= to flash the firmware locally, but it always gives errors.

First, install the needed dependencies:

#+begin_src tmux
sudo pacman -S python-crcmod # Check CRC of compiled firmware.
#+end_src

Then, clone the repository and parameterized the =Makefile= with desired options:

#+begin_src tmux
git clone https://github.com/kamilsss655/uv-k5-firmware-custom
cd uv-k5-firmware-custom
# You may wnt to edit the Makefile
#+end_src

Finally, compile the firmware:

#+begin_src bash :eval never
make
#+end_src

Flash the firmware using the web interface by uploading the resulting
=firmware.packed.bin= binary.

** Documentation

The rich documentation can be downloaded offline:

#+begin_src tmux
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/doc/uv-k5-firmware-custom-wiki"
git clone "https://github.com/kamilsss655/uv-k5-firmware-custom.wiki.git" "$HOME/.local/share/doc/uv-k5-firmware-custom-wiki"
#+end_src

** Flashing

Firmware flashing is supported by an official Windows application called
"Programming Software-Neutral". Jacek "SQ5BPF" Lipkowski developed [[https://github.com/sq5bpf/k5prog][K5Prog]], an
EEPROM reader/writer and firmware patcher for the UV-K5 in C under Linux.
WhosMatt developed [[https://github.com/whosmatt/uvmod][UVMod]], a firmware patcher with a [[https://whosmatt.github.io/uvmod/][web interface]] to customize
the selected features. Egzumer's forked it to keep the web-based patcher
without the customization feature, called [[https://egzumer.github.io/uvtools/][UVTools]].

[[https://github.com/kamilsss655/uv-k5-firmware-custom/wiki/60-%E2%80%90-Flashing-the-firmware][Flashing procedure]] is:
1. Power the K5 while maintaining the PTT button pressed, the LED should be ON.
2. Only now, first plug the Jack programming cable into the radio and then,
   plug the USB adapter into the computer -- in this order.
3. Check that a =pl2303= converter is detected as =ttyUSB0= under =dmesg=.
4. Proceed to firmware flashing from software, the LED should blink.
5. If the flasher does not detect the radio in flashing mode, try executing the
   flash command several time, disconnect/reconnect the USB adapter, or restart
   the application / refresh the web page.

** Programming

Memory programming is supported by [[https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home][CHIRP]]. The procedure is to simply connect
the powered ON radio to the computer using the programmatic cable. If using an
custom firmware, a new "CHIRP driver" may be needed to support it. For example,
the custom [[https://github.com/egzumer/uvk5-chirp-driver][uvk5-chirp-driver]] driver has been officially added to CHIRP to
support Egzumer firmware.
